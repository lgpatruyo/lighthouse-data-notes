### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`,`>`,`===`,etc.) in the mode REPL, which you can launch using the 'node' command in Vagrand.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
fucntion whattDoForLuncg(hungry, availableTime) {
    console.log("hungry is", hungry);
    console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
